Lab 1: Coding DES, AES using cryptopp library
A. Required:
+) Mode of operations:
  - Select mode from screen (using switch case)
  - Support modes:  ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS, CCM, GCM.
  - 
+) Funtions: Key generation, encryption, decryption function:
   Select from screen (using command-line or GUI)

+) Inputs:
  - Secret key,  Initialization Vector IV, and nonce,..
  Select from screen (using command-line or GUI)
  Case 1: Secret key and IV are randomly chosen for each run time
  Case 2: Input Secret Key and IV from file (using file name/)

- Plaintext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamse (using setmode, UTF-8)
- Ciphertext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamese (using setmode, UTF-8)

+) Output (hex/base64 encode, binary):
   - display in screen;
   - write to file;
